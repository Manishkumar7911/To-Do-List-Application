A simple To-Do List Application helps users manage daily tasks by allowing them to add, view, and remove tasks. This project is an excellent way to practice Python fundamentals, such as working with lists, functions, loops, and conditionals.
 # features:
 Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
View Tasks: Users can view all the tasks they have added, along with their status (e.g., pending or completed).
Remove Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by specifying the task name or index.
Mark Tasks as Completed (Optional): Users can mark tasks as completed, helping them keep track of what has been done and what still needs attention.
